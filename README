Current features:

reveal ip and node id information for every visible node on the new overview
enter a query for cloudkick nodes in the chrome address bar/omnibox 
toggle javascript debug mode (requires Charles)
toggle css debug mdoe (requires Charles)

To install it if you're interested:

git clone git@github.com:cloudkick/chromekick.git
open chrome://extensions/ in chrome
Toggle developer mode on the top right
Click 'load unpacked extension'
Navigate to the chromekick folder git created and click 'select'

That's it!

An extension is better than doing this in the app because we can do whatever
we want and don't have to worry about breaking our app or maintaining or
making it pretty.

If you want to contribute or have an idea feel free to contribute.

There's a style sheet 'content_style.css' you can edit to make any changes
you want anywhere on cloudkick and it will only be visible to people who have
the extension installed.
